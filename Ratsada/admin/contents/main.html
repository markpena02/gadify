                        Development (GAD) Office at USeP. It uses the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG)
                        and Gender Mainstreaming Evaluation Framework (GMEF) tools.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-center white-text">All proposals, projects, and research requests must undergo a GAD evaluation
                        to ensure they meet GAD criteria before being approved.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>System Admin: This role is managed by the Chair and allows the admin to oversee all
                                system activities. The admin can create, delete, and edit user accounts and ensure
                                the system's integrity.</li>
                            <li>Evaluators: A committee of four members, appointed by the university president,
                                reviews proposals to assess their "gender responsiveness." Each proposal is evaluated
                                by one member, but all must agree on the assessment before a decision is sent to the
                                proposer. Evaluators can access proposers' documents and provide feedback on their
                                evaluations.</li>
                            <li>Proposers: University staff or department heads submit proposals for projects,
                                research, or other requests to the GAD Office for approval. Proposers use the system
                                to submit their proposals and supporting documents and track their submissions. They
                                receive feedback and decision letters through the system.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>HGDG Tool: The HGDG tool helps evaluate projects for gender responsiveness. It
                                includes a checklist that the evaluators use to rate projects based on how well they
                                consider the needs of all genders.</li>
                            <li>GMEF Tool: The GMEF tool serves as a file archiving system for storing project files
                                and other documentation related to GAD Office work. These records provide evidence of
                                the university's gender-responsive practices and are used for audits every three
                                years.</li>
